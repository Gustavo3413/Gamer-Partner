# Gamer-Partner

This is a website individual project made for a college assignment at Conestoga College. It focuses on measuring my design and code skills.

I made the logo from scratch using Adobe Illustrator. Other assets like icons and pixel art images were acquired in public repositories.

The project focuses on using my HTML and CSS skills and developing a website using best practices. JS will only be a big concern if it becomes necessary at some point.

Files are available both in zip files or individually.
